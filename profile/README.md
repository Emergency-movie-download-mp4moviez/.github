# Review of *Emergency* (2022)

*Emergency* is a thought-provoking dark comedy-thriller that masterfully blends sharp social commentary with moments of gripping tension and humor. Directed by Carey Williams and based on KD DÃ¡vila's award-winning Sundance short film, the movie is a standout for its ability to tackle complex issues like racial bias, privilege, and friendship within a tightly paced, suspenseful narrative.

## Plot Summary
The story revolves around three college friendsâ€”Kunle (Donald Elise Watkins), Sean (RJ Cyler), and Carlos (Sebastian Chacon)â€”who embark on what is meant to be an epic night of partying. However, their plans are derailed when they discover an unconscious, drunk white girl in their living room. Caught in a dilemma, they must decide whether to call the authoritiesâ€”a choice fraught with potential peril given their racial identitiesâ€”or take matters into their own hands.

## What Works
1. **Sharp Writing and Humor**: The screenplay by KD DÃ¡vila is razor-sharp, mixing moments of laugh-out-loud humor with heart-pounding suspense. The dialogue feels real, and the film avoids heavy-handed moralizing, letting its situations speak volumes.
   
2. **Performances**: RJ Cyler shines as the charismatic, impulsive Sean, while Donald Elise Watkins brings depth to Kunle, the cautious and idealistic friend. Their chemistry is electric and provides an emotional anchor for the story.

3. **Social Commentary**: *Emergency* doesn't shy away from addressing the fear and mistrust that Black and Brown people often experience when interacting with law enforcement. These moments are both poignant and gut-wrenching, forcing viewers to confront uncomfortable truths.

4. **Tonal Balance**: The film juggles comedy, drama, and thriller elements deftly. It's a rare achievement to find a movie that makes you laugh, cringe, and reflect all within the span of 90 minutes.

## What Could Be Improved
- **Pacing in the Middle Act**: While the film is mostly engaging, there are moments in the second act where the momentum dips slightly.
- **Supporting Characters**: Some of the secondary characters feel underdeveloped, serving more as plot devices than fully fleshed-out individuals.

## Final Thoughts
*Emergency* is a bold, timely film that delivers both entertainment and insight. Its unique premise, compelling performances, and meaningful themes make it a must-watch for those who enjoy socially conscious cinema. While it doesn't provide easy answers, it leaves you thinking long after the credits roll.

**Rating**: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† (4/5)

This is a movie that deserves to be on your radarâ€”prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions.
